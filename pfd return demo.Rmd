This is a demonstration of the pfd.return function.  It calculates preferred returns in typical private equity structures.  

It takes four arguments as follows  

  * `cf` is a cash flow zoo object with negative values for draws
  * `int` is the annual preferred return rate
  * `freq` is the compounding period, 1 for annual, 4 for quarterly and 12 for monthly
  * `mdate` is for measurement date which forces an accounting on the measurement date
    + cash flows after the measurement date are ignored
    + if measurement date is not provided, then the model is to extended to the end of the current fiscal period as determined by the compounding rate

#asset management fee apportioned by weight of contributed capital
